# Computational-Physics-Term-Paper-Project

The project aims to solve a physics problem using numerical techniques as a part of term paper project in the course P452-Computational Physics. This folder contains the necessary details and progress of the project. It also contains the codes used to solve the problem statement.

## Problem Statement - 

## Description of the project
### Heat diffusion in metal rods
The most simple system to apply the diffusion equation is the heat transfer in metal rods. Here we apply it to three different cases to understand the heat diffusion equation and find the flow of heat with both length and time.
